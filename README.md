# generativeSensorPolicies
This project is for sharing data collected from 300 Android applications. The corpus is divided into two parts:

1. Corpus 1 and Corpus 2: Distilled data (format described below)
2. Raw APK data

Distilled data contains the following directories:
1. Text description files: Each app has the full textual description
2. Lemmatized text files: Text files on which lemmatization has been applied to
3. Uses permission files: The actual permissions requested by the app identified from Android.xml file
4. Highest frequency words and frequency by permission: The frequency counts for each application

The raw APK data is also made available for the keen user at (https://ibm.box.com/s/n3fre1ltdsb5hdievvyiq7f1urdw762q).

The data was collected so that the app coverage across well known as well as "dubious" apps is achieved.
