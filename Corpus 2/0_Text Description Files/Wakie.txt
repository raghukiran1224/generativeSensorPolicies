Ask questions, get answers, give advice, help others and meet new people. Socialize when bored, express feelings through voice calls. Wakie, the social app for phone calls, is great for all of that.  Now, you can create any topic you want to discuss and get matched with someone who would make a good conversation partner. That person could be anyone in the world, as long as you speak a common language!  Topics can be anything, from lighthearted subjects like “I want to practice Spanish with a native speaker” or “Where’s the best surfing in the world?” to more serious questions such as, “I’m having trouble getting through to my children and could use some advice.”  Within seconds, Wakie will dial you into a phone call with someone interested in responding to your topic.  People all over the world are on Wakie, so it’s a great way to learn about other cultures, talk to locals when traveling, and just get new perspectives on life.
