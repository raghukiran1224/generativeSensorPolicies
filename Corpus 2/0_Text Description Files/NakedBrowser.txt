This thread discusses violations in several popular web browsers: http://tinyurl.com/pbrowse Not concerned with privacy? Spying wastes resources (battery, bandwidth, CPU) and slows your device.  DATA Naked Browser does not use data to spy, monitor, or even show ads. All data transfer is solely as a result of your requests & retrievals. Because Naked Browser is designed for efficiency, you may use more data simply because you can browse sites faster.  SECURITY Naked Browser uses the Android WebView that's on your device to display web pages. All data requests & retrievals, all cookies, all passwords, etc. are handled by the WebView and Naked Browser does not interfere with the default behavior. However, versions of Android before 5.0 do not get System WebView updates via the Play Store, and there are known problems with older WebView: http://google.com/search?q=android+same+origin+policy%2C+freak+attack%2C+logjam%2C+address+spoofing Android 7+ uses Chrome as WebView, if installed.  PERMISSIONS • Internet: ONLY for your web page requests & retrievals. Absolutely no monitoring or snooping, & ad-less too. • File read/write: ONLY so you can save & upload files. Absolutely no other reason. • View network state: ONLY to handle changes in network connectivity. • Keep device from sleeping: ONLY to prevent downloads from being cut off.
