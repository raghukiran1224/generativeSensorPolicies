OneSync lets you automatically sync and share unlimited files and folders with Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage and with your other devices. It is an ideal tool for photo sync, photo upload, music download, document and file backup, automatic file transfer, automatic file sharing between devices,...  New files in your device are instantly uploaded to OneDrive. New files in OneDrive are automatically downloaded onto your device. If you delete a file on one side, it will be deleted on the other side. It works across multiple devices (your phone and your tablet). If their folders are synced with the same OneDrive account, they will be kept in sync with each other.  This is how OneDrive desktop client works but it's not the same with the official OneDrive app. The OneDrive app is all manual. OneSync is all about automation.
