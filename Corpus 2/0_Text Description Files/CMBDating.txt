We totally get it. You’re tired of wasting time endlessly swiping, browsing, and messaging - only to never hear back. You only want to spend time on relevant, high quality matches.  Every day at noon, you‘ll receive potential matches (we call them Bagels) preselected for you so you don’t have to swipe all day. Fellas, you will receive highly curated matches preselected for you by our smart algorithm. Ladies, we will prioritize showing you Bagels that have already liked you and are serious about connecting with you. Why? Because we are fed up with all the swiping and ghosting, and wanted to make sure your time and energy would be focused on guys who are serious about taking the next step. That's right. No more dating games, only guys who like you!  Once there is a match, we’ll connect you in a private chat room and provide icebreaker questions to get your conversation started. We even follow up to encourage actual dates.  Every day, we get smarter by learning what you like. This means over time, your match quality will improve. For our LGBTQ members, we have a slightly different process. Every day at noon, both men and women will receive potential matches preselected just for you.  PRIVACY: We’ll ask you to authenticate via Facebook so we can recommend matches who are friends of your friends. We NEVER post anything on Facebook.
