Powered by Baidu’s Deep Speech 2 recognition system, TalkType provides an extremely accurate voice to text dictation experience that will boost your input speed to the limit!  Many of you told us that our speech engine is better than Google Voice Typing. Especially with auto punctuation and continuous recognition, we are focus on optimizing and improving the voice experience in every single way instead of put voice as a side feature. You've never realized how easy, fast, natural and comfortable typing is with your voice! According to a research study by Stanford, our DS2 speech system is up to 3 times faster with an error rate 20% lower than typing on a touch screen keyboard.  TalkType works on ANY apps that allow input entry. Use your voice whether you are texting using SMS, Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, writing notes in Google Keep or EverNote, composing an email or long article without using your fat fingers!  While presenting the best voice dictate interface, we haven't ignored the regular alphabet keyboard either. TalkType provides a fully functional keyboard with Swipe, Emoji, GIF sharing, themes and support 20+ languages.

Automatic Punctuation: TalkType is able to predict and add the right punctuations, including commas, periods and even question marks, automatically without you even needing to pause.

With your preferences, feel free to take long pauses between sentences, gather your thoughts and dictate your idea whenever you need. (Go to Settings -> Voice Input -> Auto Stop to change the preferences)  Voice Command: Instead of adding punctuations automatically, you can also use voice commands to input punctuations such as “comma”, “period”, "Question mark", "Exclamation point", "Next Line", "Next Paragraph", "Smiley Face" -> 😊 and "Sad Face" -> 😞  Word Suggestion: Tap underlined words to view the suggested alternatives. It enables a quick correction of words via dictation and replacement.  QuickShare: Browse, search and share GIFs from Giphy or restaurants and places from Yelp. Or even share your current location.

For single-word selection, place one finger on the trackpad and move to navigate to select words quickly. For multi-word selection, place two fingers on the trackpad and move to navigate to select multiple words or sentences.  Swipe: Can't talk? You can swipe to enter text! Just swipe your finger from the first word to the last word. (only available on non-tablet devices)  Beautiful Themes: Beautiful material themes to make your keyboard shine.
