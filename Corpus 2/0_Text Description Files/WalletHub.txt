A: Yes, it’s 100% free, and we’ll never even ask you for a credit card number.  Q: Will Using WalletHub Hurt My Credit? A: Not at all. It’s only a “soft” inquiry when you check your latest credit report and score through WalletHub. So WalletHub may only help your credit as a result.  Q: Why WalletHub? A: While there are a number of places to get a free credit score and free credit report (or at least a free trial) – from Credit Karma to Capital One’s Credit Wise – WalletHub is the only free credit score app to offer daily updates and a clear action plan. We’ll also give you personalized credit-improvement tips and help you maximize your savings as well as minimize your debt.  Q: How Will WalletHub Save Me Money? A: Whether you have excellent credit or bad credit, WalletHub will automatically hunt for better deals so you’ll never get taken advantage of. And if your credit isn’t perfect, we’ll also help you improve it, enabling you to save thousands each year on your credit cards, mortgage, auto loan, student loan, car insurance and more. A strong credit rating will help indirectly with potential employers and landlords, too.  Q: Can WalletHub Help Me Improve My Credit? A: WalletHub analyzes your latest credit score and report to identify your credit strengths and weaknesses. We then run a number of simulations to determine how different actions will impact your credit standing. Finally, we present you with a customized credit-improvement plan, along with a comprehensive credit scorecard. You can check it out on your account’s Credit Analysis page.  As your credit score improves, WalletHub will also give you personalized tips about which credit cards offer the highest approval odds and the most savings.   Q: How Does 24/7 Credit Monitoring Work? A: WalletHub’s free credit monitoring keeps round-the-clock watch on your TransUnion credit report and will notify you whenever there is an important change. In addition to email alerts, you can also customize your WalletHub account to receive SMS alerts, which most credit monitoring services don’t provide. This will give you the chance to quickly confirm the accuracy of credit-report changes and, if necessary, start sorting out any problems before they really get out of hand.
