The world’s hottest app – Forbes.

10 billion matches later, Tinder has changed the way people meet around the world. It’s so much more than a dating app. Tinder is a powerful tool to meet people, expand your social group, meet locals when you’re traveling and find people you otherwise never would have met. Making new connections on Tinder is easy and fun—just Swipe Right to Like someone, or Swipe Left to pass. If someone likes you back, It’s a Match! Chat online with your matches, step away from your phone, get out and experience something new in the real world. It’s that simple!
