Pinterest is full of possibilities to design your life. Discover recipes, style inspiration, projects for your home and other ideas to try.

Just some of the things you can do with Pinterest:

• Find everyday ideas you love—what to make for dinner, what to put on your walls, what to wear and more ideas for every part of your life.

• Save ideas for later—organize ideas by topic, so they’re always easy to find.

• Search by keyword or with your camera—discover ideas inspired by anything you point the Pinterest camera at.

• Collaborate with friends—save ideas together for your next group trip, party or project. 

• Save ideas you find around the web—just use the Pinterest’s Save button on your mobile browser.
