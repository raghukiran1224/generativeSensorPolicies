Get Cortana and never miss a beat!
Bring your personal assistant to your phone to help you keep track of the important stuff wherever you are, across your devices.
Set a reminder on your PC to pick something up at the store and she’ll alert you on your phone when you get there.
Miss a call on your phone and she’ll let you know on your PC, and send a reply text for you.
If traffic’s a mess and you need to leave early to make that meeting, Cortana’s got your back.
If you need to find a fast answer or info on a flight or package, just ask. 
And Cortana is a truly personal assistant who gets to know you better all the time so she can help track the things you’re passionate about, like your favorite artist or sports team, and give you smarter recommendations.
