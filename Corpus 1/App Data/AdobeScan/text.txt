The free Adobe Scan app turns your device into a powerful portable scanner that recognizes text automatically (OCR). Turn anything — receipts, notes, documents, pictures, business cards, whiteboards — into an Adobe PDF with content you can reuse. 
HOW IT WORKS:
• CAPTURE. Scan anything with precision. Advanced image technology automatically detects borders and sharpens scanned content.
• ENHANCE. Touch up scans or photos from your camera roll. Easily preview, reorder, crop, rotate, and adjust color.
• REUSE. Turn your scan into a high-quality Adobe PDF that unlocks content through automated text recognition.

It’s that easy.
